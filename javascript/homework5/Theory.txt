An escape character enables you to output characters you wouldn't normally be able to, usually because the browser will interpret it differently to what you intended.

In JavaScript, the backslash (\) is an escape character.

As an example, let's say I want to display the following text: They call it an "escape" character.

***********document.write("They call it an \"escape\" character");**************

The above code will display the double quotes as intended.
