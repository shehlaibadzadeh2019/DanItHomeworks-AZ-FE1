1. Explain in your own words the difference between declaring variables via var, let and const.

	The old-fashioned way to declare a variable in JavaScript is by using the var keyword. In "var" we can initialize the value of that variable.
	The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.
	Const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

2. Why is declaration of a variable via var considered a bad tone?
    
	Using var in this context would require a situation in which a variable declared inside a function would need to be used in the global scope
